            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <q>A breach of union, or a cauſleſſe ſeparation, from a truly ſtated Church.</q> The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them is onely this, which of them hath the true <hi>Church ſtate;</hi> which if it be determined, they all agree in the concluſion: <q>A breach of union with, or a cauſeleſſe ſeparation from ſuch a Church ſo ſtated, is a Schiſm.</q>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58208:7"/> Thus the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> argued, as himſelf propounded their argument of Schiſm, <hi>pag.</hi> 189. thus the <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> party, thus the <hi>Preſbyterians.</hi> But it ſeems, the reverend Doctor conjectured aright, that the <hi>oppoſition</hi> was like to ariſe from ſome of the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> party, though he miſtook the reaſons; <q>The preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices that they might fear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and intereſts, obnoxious to, by a reception and ſtabliſhment of that his notion of Schiſm:</q> Which what they could be, I cannot conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.

               <p>THe reverend Doctor begins this Chapter with a <hi>complaint,</hi> (as his Book is full of ſuch, either <hi>cauſleſſe</hi> or <hi>needleſſe,</hi> complaints) of <q>my repetition of his words, of ſuch as I could wreſt, by cutting off one and another parcell, &amp;c. to ſerve me, to make biting refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon them, with whom I have to deal.</q> To which I ſhall return but this: 1.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58208:35"/> own ſword into his own bowells, is an allowed way of <hi>cleareſt victory;</hi> and more than this, I have not done. That which a man <hi>condemns</hi> in another, may juſtly be applyed to his <hi>ſelf-condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> if he be <hi>guilty</hi> of the ſame crime.

               <p>Pag. 148. <q>For my part, I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe Independents, which allow no communion of Churches, but what is prudentiall.</q> It ſeems, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Doctor is little acquainted with the <hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>Independents,</hi> in new and old <hi>England;</hi> yea, he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not the very <hi>name</hi> of an <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> Church, which what doth it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, but an <hi>Independency,</hi> or <hi>non commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of one Church with another, as <hi>Churches,</hi> as I noted, <hi>pag.</hi> 155. at leaſt of <hi>divine inſtitution.</hi> The reſt, what is it but <hi>prudentiall,</hi> or <hi>communion</hi> of members of the Catholick Church? And I ſhall onely propound this to his conſideration: 1. Whether if there be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58208:72"/> any <hi>communion</hi> of Churches, as Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (which he grants, or elſe <hi>equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi>) there be not a <hi>breach</hi> of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and union, (and ſo a <hi>ſchiſm</hi>) <q>When one Church refuſes to hold tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> communion with another, which ought to be between them;</q> which before, and now, he denies: <q>it is no ſchiſm, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called:</q> Unleſſe he mean, it is not <hi>properly</hi> ſo called, with reſpect to his <hi>new notion</hi> of ſchiſm. But now he is upon the <hi>common</hi> notion of ſchiſm, a <hi>breach of union</hi> or unity; and then it is a <hi>ſchiſm,</hi> to refuſe that communion, which ought (by divine appointment) to be between them. 2. They having acknowledged our <hi>Churches</hi> to be true Churches, and then ſome <hi>communion</hi> to be due to us, as Churches; how can they <hi>ſeparate</hi> from us, and refuſe <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with us, without a <hi>breach of union,</hi> and ſo without <hi>ſchiſm?</hi> unleſſe he mean, they allow <hi>communion</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Churches, by inſtitution of Chriſt, but not with ours; no not ſo much as <hi>prudentiall,</hi> as Churches. 3. Many <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents</hi> (and the reverend Doctor with them) ſeem to hold, that <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:58208:72"/> of Churches by <hi>Delegates,</hi> in a <hi>Councill</hi> or <hi>Synod,</hi> is onely <hi>pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,</hi> and not of <hi>Chriſts</hi> inſtitution; and then he may mean, there is no <hi>breach</hi> of union, in refuſing to hold that <hi>communion,</hi> becauſe it is not an <hi>union</hi> or communion of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. To conclude this, how little reaſon the reverend Doctor had, to cry out of <hi>outragious injury</hi> done him, in thoſe words of mine; <q>Is not the deſigne of his Book to prove, if he could, and condemn us as no Churches? Let the world be judge.</q> When he hath often told us, that in <hi>ſeparation</hi> from us, they have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>no union</hi> of Chriſts inſtitution; as I have often ſaid. And here tells us, <q>I have no more ſeparated from you, than you have done from me:<note place="margin">Of ſchiſm, pag. <hi>218.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </q> Which how unreaſonably (I will not ſay, outragiouſly) <hi>falſ</hi> it is, I ſay again, let the world, and <hi>Saints,</hi> and who wil, be judge. And then conſider, what need there was, of his <q>forgivneſſe, of all my reproaches, revilings, &amp;c.</q> which appear to be none. But though I am unjuſtly charged all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58208:73"/> along, with ſuch <hi>miſcariages,</hi> the reverend Doctor <q>ſhall have a place in my heart and prayers.</q> And ſo much of his ninth Chapter.</p>
               <p>Pag. 146. <q>What Independentiſm is, he doth neither here declare, nor do I know what it is that he intends by it; the name is invidiouſly broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and diſowned by them to whom it is aſcribed, &amp;c.</q> But 1. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Doctor is very forgetfull, of what he ſaies; for he told us once before, <hi>pag.</hi> 47. <q>Though he name not that party, yet it is evident whom he intends.</q> And once again, <hi>pag.</hi> 148. <q>What Sect it is, any man may judge, that takes the leaſt view of his Treatiſe.</q> My Treatiſe was intended againſt all <hi>ſorts</hi> of <hi>Independents,</hi> and againſt himſelf as one of them; for they all plead their <hi>Congregations</hi> to be Independent, having all <hi>Church-power</hi> within themſelves, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominates them all <hi>Independents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Anat. of Indep. p. <hi>37, 38.</hi>
                  </note> though they otherwiſe differ one with another. 2. That <hi>invidious name,</hi> however diſowned by them, was firſt of their own <hi>invention,</hi> and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58208:73"/> by practiſe, (as well as by the former Doctrine) arrogated to themſelves. 3. They all agree alſo in <hi>ſeparation from our Churches;</hi> they <hi>unchurch</hi> our Churches, <hi>unminiſter</hi> our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 148. With ſuch I deal. He asks, <q>Is this Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm a ſchiſm, properly ſo called? I hope he did not expect, that I ſhould plead for it. I deny that I unminiſter their Miniſters, &amp;c.</q> How he can with <hi>conſcience</hi> deny this, of moſt of the <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Independents,</hi> I much wonder; not onely <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> but ſome of his own <hi>way,</hi> not yet gone ſo far, do <hi>ſeparate</hi> from our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>unminiſter</hi> our Miniſters, &amp;c. And his own <hi>principles</hi> do the ſame, and will ere long lead him thither, as I have abundantly proved. But what means he by <hi>Independentiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 149. <q>If by Independentiſm he underſtands, the peaceable procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any of the people of God, in this Nation, in the ſeverall parts of it, to joyne themſelves, by their free conſent, to walk together in the obſervation of all the Ordinances of
